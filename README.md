# CI/CD Demo

This repo is a demo designed to demonstrate what a good CI/CD setup would look like, and what benefits you would get from it.

It includes the most important elements of a good CI/CD pipeline, which are:

- [ ] automated tests
- [ ] code checks and pull request feedback
- [x] automatic deployment
- [ ] security scanning
- [ ] software defined infrastructure (infrastructure as code)
